# RPSSL

A web app implementation of **Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard** through an ASP.NET REST Service.

## Game victory algorithm

Each valid shape a player can use is mapped to an ID number. The IDs are numbers 1 through 5, in the same order as the order the shapes take in the name of the game (eg. *Paper* is 2, *Spock* is 4).

With IDs mapped this way, we see that the IDs in the first column only win against IDs in columns two and three:

| Shape  | Weak shape 1 | Weak shape 2 |
|:------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|   1    |      3       |      5       |
|   2    |      1       |      4       |
|   3    |      2       |      5       |
|   4    |      1       |      3       |
|   5    |      2       |      4       |

Analyzing the table, we can see that shapes only win against IDs which are bigger by 2 or 4 in modulo 5, ergo they lose against IDs bigger by 1 or 3.

Simplified, this means that if *shape_1* and *shape_2* are not the same, and the difference between their IDs in modulo 5 is an **even** number then *shape_1* **wins**, otherwise it **loses**.
