# RPSSL

A web app implementation of **Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard** through an ASP.NET REST Service.

## Test UI

To setup the [test UI](https://codechallenge.boohma.com/) you need to input the root url of this API: <https://localhost:[port]/api>.

After that the basic functionallities of the API can be tested in this lightweight environment.

## Random number generation

For random number generation an external service is being used.

The URL of that service is configurable. It is located in the appsettings.json configurations, under the 'ConnectionStrings' section, with field name 'ExternalRandomGeneratorUrl'.

## Game victory algorithm

Each valid shape a player can use is mapped to an ID number. The IDs are numbers 1 through 5, in the same order as the order the shapes take in the name of the game (eg. *Paper* is 2, *Spock* is 4).

With IDs mapped this way, we see that the IDs in the first column only win against IDs in columns two and three:

| Shape  | Weak shape 1 | Weak shape 2 |
|:------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|   1    |      3       |      5       |
|   2    |      1       |      4       |
|   3    |      2       |      5       |
|   4    |      1       |      3       |
|   5    |      2       |      4       |

Analyzing the table, we can see that shapes only win against IDs which are bigger by 2 or 4 in modulo 5, ergo they lose against IDs bigger by 1 or 3.

Simplified, this means that if *shape_1* and *shape_2* are not the same, and the difference between their IDs in modulo 5 is an **even** number then *shape_1* **wins**, otherwise it **loses**.
